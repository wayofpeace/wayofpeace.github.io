This project analyzes an exercise data set for the Practical Machine Learning course at coursera.org


The goal of this modeling project is to predict the manner in which participants in an exercise study lifetd a dumbell using data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell collected during the did the exercise.

Models are developed to predict the "classe" variable in the training set using any of the other variables provided.   This report describes the methods for building models and using cross validation to gain confidence in the ability of the model to predict accurately.   The expected out of sample error is provided along with a discussion of model choices. 
Finally, the best prediction model developed is used to predict 20 different test cases. 

The development and blind test data was provided by researchers at http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har as a part of the study:
